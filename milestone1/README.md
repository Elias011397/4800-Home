# Milestone 1: Problem Proposal

 A big issue most college students come across is time management. College is a very busy time between school, work, and personal life, and some students struggle with keeping on top of their assignments. Currently, most professors use eLC for course content. On eLC, there is a calendar feature that can show a student any important dates regarding homework, quizzes, and tests. While eLC is widely used in UGA classes, the eLC calendar is underutilized by students and professors. Furthermore, the placement of the calendar feature does not encourage use by students, and the functionality is limited on the student's end. eLC has a subscription feature for external calendar applications, but it requires students to subscribe to the calendars for all of their courses. It does not give students the option to choose which course calendars they want to subscribe to, which hinders their ability to personalize schedule.

The issue above is one that spans over all class types whether they be online, hybrid, or face-to-face, but it potentially negatively impacts face-to-face the greatest. Despite the class structure, a student may choose to skip class time in order to get extra study time in or get an assignment done in time. With face-to-face instruction, there is no fallback of a recorded lecture that is common with online and hybrid instruction. If this pattern continues throughout the semester, the student can lose out on valuable class time that could have increased their understanding of the material. For professors, this means they do not get feedback from all the students on their confusion and understanding of the course material.

While many students can figure out a time management system that works for them, for some, keeping yourself on track may be overwhelming. This is an issue not only for computer science students but for any student. At UGA, most professors and faculty use eLC for sharing class material and more, so each student interacts with it numerous times a day potentially. If students were able to more clearly view upcoming assignments and assessments (in class or online), this could encourage them to be more mindful of deadlines and important dates. This will reduce overall stress and help students be better prepared for face-to-face class. In turn, it would be easier for the professor to know if extra help or extending a deadline may be necessary.

 Right now, there is no standard to how professors must use eLC, so each class uses eLC in different ways. For example, if an assignment or assessment is turned in or done in class, a professor may not put this date into eLC. Since each professor uses eLC differently, the calendar is not consistently used and is rarely given importance to putting in material online.
