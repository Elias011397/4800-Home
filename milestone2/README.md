# Problem Introduction 


 

College is a time of transition for many young students. For many students, college is the first time they have complete control over their day-to-day lives. Students are taking on even more as they prepare for a professional career, and time management is often the key to success for many, leading to better academic performance and lower stress levels (Huang). At UGA, each student is automatically added to classes on eLC that they have registered for. Many instructors opt to use eLC to share course content, receive homework, and perform online assessments. However, it is ultimately up to the instructor if they want to use eLC and to what degree they use it. For students, eLC is their primary resource for all course content – including the syllabus, homework, lecture videos, presentations, rubrics, etc. While eLC does have a calendar function that shows all events created by instructors in each class, it is not being used to its full potential to help students be set up for success. 

The goal of Planet Express this semester is to update the calendar design on eLC. The calendar page on eLC is split into two main sections. The bigger left portion allows a user to look at the upcoming events created in a variety of ways. A user can view the calendar in an agenda, daily, weekly, monthly, and list view. The smaller right portion depicts a small calendar with the dates and a blue dot to signify when an event is occurring. Under the calendar is an area for the user to type a list of tasks for themselves. This page can be accessed from the home page and any Course Home page on the right side of the screen under the “Calendar” widget. The current setup is very simple and is generally easy to use, but the overall design of the Calendar page does not encourage serious use from instructors or students. 

 Time management is an important skill for both students and professionals, so the resources used in day-to-day tasks should be helping the users gain the feeling of control over their time as life becomes more demanding. eLC is used by every student and every instructor to some capacity almost every day at UGA. As a tool that is supposed to be a hub for all course content, assessments, and drop box, the calendar feature should be improved to be useful to the thousands of students and instructors. 

Fall 2021 is the first semester of face-to-face instruction since the start of the COVID pandemic, making it an even more stressful time for many. For some students, going to face-to-face instruction on campus is a new experience, and it may be hard to juggle classes, work, and personal life. Time management can help bring some peace to a student or instructor and reduce their need to memorize different tasks all the time (Huang). 

 We hope to increase the experience of both the students and the instructors who use eLC frequently throughout the day. Whenever a student accesses a Course Home page on eLC, the calendar widget is almost always shown and can immediately tell the student what is upcoming for that class. This widget is helpful for a quick reference, but for more visual thinkers, seeing the events in a calendar layout – whether it be monthly, weekly, or daily – could potentially help the student use their time more wisely and understand how busy the current day, week, or month is, leading students to develop time management skills (Huang). For instructors, we hope that a new layout for the calendar page will encourage instructors to use the calendar feature to remind students of upcoming assignments or assessments. Instructors should be promoting ways for UGA students to seize control of their time and alleviate the stress common among students (Nonis). We believe by promoting the use of the calendar function, it may help students come to class more prepared and be more engaging with the material. 

Typically, there is not a lot of interaction with the Calendar feature from eLC from the student perspective. The most interaction a student may typically have is viewing upcoming events on the Calendar widget on the eLC homepage or on any Course Home page. A student accesses eLC for various reasons: to submit homework, review lecture slides, complete a quiz, etc. Whatever the reason, a student may decide to look at the Calendar widget to see if they have any upcoming events they should know about. The most the student user will have to do is look at the widget, and they should be able to see if they have anything upcoming for a specific class. If they don’t see anything, the student may assume they do not have any upcoming events or assignments. If they see an upcoming event, they know that there is an assignment or assessment that they will have to prepare for. Depending on their instructor, there could be important upcoming events that the student should know about but is not included on eLC. In that case, the student user has failed their goal of seeing if they have any upcoming events. 

From an instructor’s perspective, they interact most with the eLC calendar when they are creating an event for existing assessments, assignments, or course content. Their goal is to create an event that lines up with the deadline of existing eLC material. Instructors must go to the Calendar page, press the “Create Event” button, and fill out the “Create Event” page. After the event has been created, the event becomes public to all users enrolled in that class. Since the event has been officially created, the goal is now completed successfully. The outcome may later change if the deadline changes, if there was incomplete information, or if the wrong content was attached to the event. 

# Analysis of Existing Solutions 


 

A company named Clockwise created a calendar assistant for office workers that allow users to designate how much uninterrupted “focus time” that they need.  The assistant uses that information to move meetings around so that everyone in that office can have a decent amount of time for work each day (Matney).  There are a lot of events in a student’s calendar that cannot be moved, like due dates for assignments.  But a calendar assistant that evaluates their schedule considers the amount of focus time that they want, and then simply makes suggestions, could be useful.  It would alleviate students’ stress because they would not have to manage their schedules all by themselves, but it would be expensive to implement.  Some companies, like Apple, add heat maps to their calendars (Christoffel).  All heat maps have a color scale, like yellow to red.  The busiest times of the month are colored red.  Parts of the month that are not busy are yellow.  Users can look at their heat maps to figure out which parts of the month will be best for scheduling new events.  This is an aesthetically pleasing way to manage one’s schedule.  A major drawback for all these solutions is that adding things to a digital calendar could make it more complex, and therefore harder to navigate for disabled students. 

Our biggest concern is changing the design of the calendar.  Things like changing the calendar’s placement to make it more prominent, changing the layout to improve usability, and placing all upcoming due dates on the eLC homepage would help students keep up with their work.  We also want to add some new features to the calendar to effectively tackle the problem of time management.  Giving students the ability to create separate calendars that can be used by more than one student would be helpful for group projects.  Giving students the ability to color-code calendar events or adding a heat map to the calendar would make the calendar more effective.  The calendar could still be beneficial for disabled students if the layout is not too complex.  We could further improve usability for disabled students by giving them the ability to limit the number of colors displayed on the calendar (Baric).  Referencing Norman’s Principles of Good Design, our solutions conform to the principles of visibility and feedback.  All the calendar’s new functions would be visibly clear to the student when they use them.  Also, there will be feedback that lets students know whether or not they were successfully able to make changes to their calendars.  These solutions also follow the section 508 guideline of procuring and developing accessible technology.  

# Proposed Solution  

 

For our solution, our most important goal is to fix the layout of the current Calendar page. Currently, there are a lot of issues with readability with the layout, particularly the left section. The daily, weekly, and monthly view of the calendar often cuts off event information, making it hard to immediately know what the event signifies. Furthermore, there is an area for the user to record their tasks. This feature is not popular, so possibly changing the layout or taking that feature off would allow for a better user experience.  

After fixing the layout, we want to allow customization of the calendar. Many online calendars allow users for customization of color coding, something the eLC calendar does not currently allow. Currently, the colors for each class seem to be chosen at random and do not allow for any customization from the student nor instructor. Allowing users to color-code can help with signifying which events belong to which class without reading a single word and can help users with disabilities, such as color-blindness. Color-coding would also improve the calendar shown on the right side of the screen. It currently signifies which days have events with a blue dot under the date, but the dot does not provide any further information like what class it is for, what kind of an event is it, or how important is the event for the user. Besides color-coding, we would also like to implement a system that allows users to choose a level of importance for each event. Weighting each event could help the user manage their time better, by letting the user break down the event into subtasks earlier and avoid the stress of rushing through the preparation or work for the specific event. The weighting system could also be implemented on the calendar of the right side by giving a different size to each dot depending on the level of importance. 

Our proposed solution is similar to how many calendar applications functions. The eLC calendar does not afford a lot to the users, so we would like to boost the functionality of the calendar to be like other applications. Time management starts to get difficult in college for many students, and there should be built-in tools with the resources that UGA students that encourage students to learn how to control their time. Since our updated version will be like other applications available, the user can easily switch to an application suited to their needs after graduation. Time management is just as important in college as it is in a professional career, so learning these skills now sets a student up for success in the future. 

 Since our goal is to update the Calendar page on eLC to encourage instructor and student use, the best way to measure success is to track use of the Calendar page over time. First, a baseline reading should be done to get an idea of how often students and instructors are using the Calendar on eLC, then track use among the user population after the solution is implemented. For students, increased use can look like addressing the calendar widget displayed on the eLC home page and all the Course Home pages, viewing all your upcoming assignments on the Calendar page, or using the Calendar page to quickly view and work on upcoming assignments or assessments. For instructors, increased use can be creating events for all assignments and assessments (whether they be through eLC or in class) or creating events as reminders regarding their face-to-face instruction for that day.

# The Effects of Calendar Apps on Students’ Perceived Stress  



(1) “Having the skill to schedule and knowing how to use calendar apps are essential for both students and professionals… Several studies have found that good time-management practices positively correlate to better academic performance and a lower stress level… Besides work and school, scheduling leisure time can help develop planning and goal-setting skills.” 

(2) “With the abundant features on calendar apps, the omnipresent portable digital devices, and the growing consciousness on sustainability, fewer people use paper calendars as time goes by.” 

(26) “The most similar research was by Mei (2016) examining the effects of a university’s calendar reminder on students’ time-management capacity and academic performance. In which, students have the option to import an .ics calendar file to their calendar apps as a course schedule, including due dates and exam dates… The results confirmed calendar apps’ positive effects on students’ academic performance. Furthermore, the study indicated that about half of the students do not know how to user the calendar apps effectively.” 

(30) “In the transition period from a student to a working professional, university students have more demanding tasks and higher autonomy over their studies and life than any other stage of their student career. The demands and expectations that college students face change frequently…Consequently, many university students fulfill the role of student and employee at the same time, posting challenges on their time management ability.” 

(43) “Scheduling on calendar apps also minimized the need to memorize different tasks and improvise, which enhanced students’ perceived control of time.” 

(44) “By scheduling ahead and knowing how much free time he had, he could efficiently and flexibly accommodate different tasks.” 

(45) “most informants affirmed the positive effect of calendar apps on avoiding procrastination. By putting in the deadlines and visualizing how much free time remained on the calendar, informants could better understand when they could work on the tasks and do short-range planning.” 

(45) “Most informants confirmed the positive effects of calendar apps on routine forming. Once the routine was formed, they became less reliant on the schedule… Furthermore, many informants highlighted the positive effects of routine on motivation to get things done.” 

(48) “When discussing the topic of multitasking, most informants said they preferred to focus on one task at a time, which could be facilitat3ed by visualizing deadlines on calendar apps. By having a schedule planned out and a structure that comes with it, students had better peace of mind to focus on one task since they had arranged times for other tasks.” 

(49) “There were also a few informants that preferred to multitask… They further stated that planning on calendar apps can help them identify priorities and the high- and low-effort tasks to do simultaneously, therefore helping them multitask.” 

(50) “Another way that calendar apps helped regulate effort was to break down a challenging task into smaller subtasks, which was easier to achieve on calendar apps than doing it in one’s head.” 

(50-51) “A few informants did not like to use digital devices and were reluctant to use calendar apps because using digital devices caused them stress and limited their spontaneity… many informants who used calendar apps regularly said they had gotten overreliant on calendar apps…Moreover, many students mentioned that calendar apps could indirectly exacerbate digital addiction because they got distracted by other apps on the phone when checking schedules.” 

(55) The flexibility of a schedule also encompasses leisure activities on it. Most informants stated that they do not plan out the exact timeframe for leisure activities except for the start time of meetings. Most of them thought rigid time frames induce str3ess and leisure times should be flexible.” 

(56) Many informants mentioned that having the work schedule and personal schedule separated, either in the same calendar or in different calendars, helped decouple school/work and personal life.” 

(57) “Many informants suggested that it was inconvenient and time-consuming to schedule on calendar apps… While most informants acknowledged that it was easier to check calendar apps on their phones wherever they go, some thought that the small phone screen did not provide an ideal user experience…. Moreover, even though calendar apps were cross-platform and could be opened on a computer with a bigger screen, it was much more difficult to carry a computer around and open the app from there.” 

(59) “Another factor that affected the user experience was calendar apps’ design and customization options. Some informants felt that calendar apps were too boring to user and lack customization, which was a drawback compared to paper calendars.” 

(60) “On the positive side, the scheduling process facilitat3ed productivity management and provided mental comfort by assisting in organizing tasks, tracking progress… Visualizing the deadlines set on calendar apps also motivated students to finish in time and prevent procrastination… By supporting the formation of routines, calendar apps helped students mitigate overwork and avoid distractions at home. Moreover, the results showed that calendar apps supported effort regulation; the process of scheduling motivated students to accomplish tasks, prioritize tasks, set goals, break down challenging tasks into smaller and achievable subtasks. Besides, having a task scheduled helped students focus on it better. .For those who preferred multitasking, calendar apps also helped identify tasks with different effort levels to do simultaneously.” 

(60) “Since calendar apps were on digital devices, they could exacerbate digital addictions. Many students stated that they had gotten over-reliant on calendar apps, while some were easily distracted by other apps when they used calendar apps. Moreover, the unpleasant user experience in the syncing process, scheduling process, and reliability issues also induced stress. Some informants also suggested a better design, customization option, and built-in voice assistant on calendar apps. Furthermore, different scheduling methods also affected stress in different ways. Having too many or too few items on the schedule could cause stress. Notifications also need to be set up correctly to avoid annoyance. While many students acknowledged the benefits of scheduling intermittently and systematic task-switching, they did not practice it because it was difficult to schedule this way. Besides, the rigid timeframe, misalignment between actions and the schedule, and imposed assignments could also cause stress.” 

(72) “The difficulty of scheduling on calendar apps and the lack of customization also created a gap between their potential benefits and actual ones.” 

 

# Effects of time-management practices on college grades 


 

(406) “We have observed that college students and other intellectual workers, like large institutional mainframe computers, often have a large number of information-processing tasks to do and that the tasks are of different length, complexity, priority, deadlines, and proneness to interruptions: In short, college students’ cpus are overloaded. In such circumstances it would be natural for students to consider how they might manage their mind’s time more effectively.” 

(406) “Grades in college courses, particularly undergraduate courses, often depend on managing the completion of a complex mix of jobs, including jobs with various priorities, deadlines, lengths, and other characteristics... rather than on a single challenging assignment…” 

(407) “…Short-Range Planning… appears to encompass a variety of items that require planning in the short run, either within the day or within the week…. Time Attitudes… indicate[s] that their time is used constructively and that they feel in charge of the way their time is spent…. Long-Range Planning… seem[s] to think of things in terms of a relatively wide time window. They set goals for the entire quarter, keep track of important dates on a single calendar, review material even when tests are not imminent, and do not wait until the last minute to finish working on major assignments.” 

(409) “Short-Range Planning also seems to predict grade point average, whereas Long-Range Planning does not… The college environment is one in which changes in expectations, demands, and so forth, are relatively rapid and frequent. Different parts of the same course may unpredictably differ in difficulty; the overlapping of demand from different courses is often unpredictable; nonacademic life events may cause unpredictable changes in demand, available time, or priorities; instructors may even change their mind about the due date on papers or the date an exam will be schedules; on occasion, there is no syllabus and even in courses in which there is a syllabus, there are often consequential deviations from it. Perhaps in this type of environment if the goal is to maximize grades, a short-term planning window is more optimal than a long-term planning window.” 


# Underachievement Among College Students 

(275) “Participants attributed their high school successes to minor efforts. Not needing to do much to earn the success they wanted, these students were never taught, nor ever taught themselves, how to work through challenging issues. When these participants encountered challenging coursework in college, they were unprepared to deal with it.” 

(286) “Many participants professed to studying, but most studied shortly before exams. They did not know how to pace their studies, spending time in advance to prepare for assessments…. A lack of structure in college gave some participants the false feeling of free time, and many, unaccustomed to having to set their own reading and study regimen, did not use their time wisely.” 

(288) “Students who did not know how to handle unstructured time tended to be less academically successful. Many participants mentioned a lack of self-discipline or motivation as a reason for their underachievement. In their research Coleman and Freedman (1996) found that postsecondary success is based partially on goal directedness and interpersonal problem solving. They found that students who were able to set realistic and attainable goals, successfully managed stress, consciously used strategies, and were flexible in social settings had more academic success in college.” 

# Influence of Perceived Control Over Time on College Students’ Stress and Stress-Related Outcomes 

(587) “Evidence from past research shows that stress experienced by college students relates to outcomes such as anxiety and depression, hopelessness and suicide ideation, decision-making ability, and attrition. College students clearly experience stress and could benefit from strategies to reduce it. If university personnel are to effectively promote the adjustment of students to an academic environment, they need to be aware of the types of stressors that are most common to college students and the effects of those stressors on outcomes such as academic performance and health. More importantly, university personnel should be in a position to recommend simple strategies that students could use to cope with stress.” 

(589) “By providing simple coping strategies relevant to perceived control of time, university personnel may enable students to adjust and succeed in the academic environment. From a policy point of view, this may increase retention of students and ultimately result in more funding for the institution.” 

(589) “Contrary to popular belief that time management behavior directly influences stress and stress-related outcomes such as performance, problem-solving ability, psychological and physiological health, empirical evidence suggest that it is linked instead through the perception of control over time. Only if time management behaviors (i.e., setting goals, scheduling, prioritizing, organizing) provide a person with the perception that he or she has control over time will stress reduction or changes in stress-related outcomes result.” 

(601) “Instructors should do everything possible to make the student believe that he or she has control over his or her time and not the opposite…. Having exams, assignments, and projects in shorter intervals will require the students to keep up with course work. This may result in higher levels of perceived control over time, especially for students who do not manage their time well. Also, a syllabus containing a complete time schedule (e.q., exams dates, project due dates, topics to be covered dates) and adherence to it will help students plan ahead and manage their time better…. By planning and managing activities with student time management and control in mind, instructors could give students a perception of control over their time outside of class, which could give students a perception of control over their time outside of class, which could significantly alleviate their stress level and improve their overall well-being.” 

(602) “For many students, college is their first experience in managing life’s demands…. Students should be made aware that they cannot possibly manage their time until they have the knowledge and the experience of being in control of their time. The first step in getting control of one’s time is to be aware of how one uses time. Keeping a record of how they manage their time and then later evaluating whether their time was well spent may help students decide whether to continue with their current behaviors or start making different choices.” 

 

# Existing Solutions 

 
Accel-backed Clockwise launches an AI assistant for Google Calendar – TechCrunch (Lucas Matney) 

The startup’s software, which integrates with Google Calendar, has been bringing people into the fold for shifting these meetings around, but their latest update aims to give teams the option to let its Clockwise Calendar Assistant do some of the heavy lifting automatically. 

Certain employees, like engineers, likely benefit from more uninterrupted time to work, so Clockwise gave employees a way to designate how much “focus time” they generally need per week. 

Not every meeting is in your office; when there are locations in the invites, Clockwise will account for travel between the two addresses inside your calendar. 

Clockwise is also boosting its compatibility with Slack. Users have the ability to let Clockwise turn on do-not-disturb automatically during designated “focus time” and can let the app populate their Slack status with the current meeting they’re in. 

Opinion: Of course calendar events cannot be moved around for students.  I was more interested in this article because of the AI’s ability to calculate time for travel and to let users choose how much uninterrupted “focus time” they need.  A calendar with built-in AI that assists users with time management would be very useful for students. 

Solutions at hand for the software that time forgot: The digital calendar 

This article contained some solutions for digital calendar use, but I cannot find the article. 

Using an interactive digital calendar with mobile phone reminders by senior people - a focus group study (Baric, et al) 

This article introduces the idea of creating a digital calendar for elderly users.  It mentions some features that would be useful for disabled students, like: 

Users can invite a support person to help with their calendar. 

“limiting choice of colours and limiting options for multiple windows” 

SMS reminders that can be set by the support person
