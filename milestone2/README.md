# Problem Introduction 


 

College is a time of transition for many young students. For many students, college is the first time they have complete control over their day-to-day lives. Students are taking on even more as they prepare for a professional career, and time management is often the key to success for many, leading to better academic performance and lower stress levels (Huang). At UGA, each student is automatically added to classes on eLC that they have registered for. Many instructors opt to use eLC to share course content, receive homework, and perform online assessments. However, it is ultimately up to the instructor if they want to use eLC and to what degree they use it. For students, eLC is their primary resource for all course content – including the syllabus, homework, lecture videos, presentations, rubrics, etc. While eLC does have a calendar function that shows all events created by instructors in each class, it is not being used to its full potential to help students be set up for success. 

The goal of Planet Express this semester is to update the calendar design on eLC. The calendar page on eLC is split into two main sections. The bigger left portion allows a user to look at the upcoming events created in a variety of ways. A user can view the calendar in an agenda, daily, weekly, monthly, and list view. The smaller right portion depicts a small calendar with the dates and a blue dot to signify when an event is occurring. Under the calendar is an area for the user to type a list of tasks for themselves. This page can be accessed from the home page and any Course Home page on the right side of the screen under the “Calendar” widget. The current setup is very simple and is generally easy to use, but the overall design of the Calendar page does not encourage serious use from instructors or students. 

 Time management is an important skill for both students and professionals, so the resources used in day-to-day tasks should be helping the users gain the feeling of control over their time as life becomes more demanding. eLC is used by every student and every instructor to some capacity almost every day at UGA. As a tool that is supposed to be a hub for all course content, assessments, and drop box, the calendar feature should be improved to be useful to the thousands of students and instructors. 

Fall 2021 is the first semester of face-to-face instruction since the start of the COVID pandemic, making it an even more stressful time for many. For some students, going to face-to-face instruction on campus is a new experience, and it may be hard to juggle classes, work, and personal life. Time management can help bring some peace to a student or instructor and reduce their need to memorize different tasks all the time (Huang). 

 We hope to increase the experience of both the students and the instructors who use eLC frequently throughout the day. Whenever a student accesses a Course Home page on eLC, the calendar widget is almost always shown and can immediately tell the student what is upcoming for that class. This widget is helpful for a quick reference, but for more visual thinkers, seeing the events in a calendar layout – whether it be monthly, weekly, or daily – could potentially help the student use their time more wisely and understand how busy the current day, week, or month is, leading students to develop time management skills (Huang). For instructors, we hope that a new layout for the calendar page will encourage instructors to use the calendar feature to remind students of upcoming assignments or assessments. Instructors should be promoting ways for UGA students to seize control of their time and alleviate the stress common among students (Nonis). We believe by promoting the use of the calendar function, it may help students come to class more prepared and be more engaging with the material. 

Typically, there is not a lot of interaction with the Calendar feature from eLC from the student perspective. The most interaction a student may typically have is viewing upcoming events on the Calendar widget on the eLC homepage or on any Course Home page. A student accesses eLC for various reasons: to submit homework, review lecture slides, complete a quiz, etc. Whatever the reason, a student may decide to look at the Calendar widget to see if they have any upcoming events they should know about. The most the student user will have to do is look at the widget, and they should be able to see if they have anything upcoming for a specific class. If they don’t see anything, the student may assume they do not have any upcoming events or assignments. If they see an upcoming event, they know that there is an assignment or assessment that they will have to prepare for. Depending on their instructor, there could be important upcoming events that the student should know about but is not included on eLC. In that case, the student user has failed their goal of seeing if they have any upcoming events. 

From an instructor’s perspective, they interact most with the eLC calendar when they are creating an event for existing assessments, assignments, or course content. Their goal is to create an event that lines up with the deadline of existing eLC material. Instructors must go to the Calendar page, press the “Create Event” button, and fill out the “Create Event” page. After the event has been created, the event becomes public to all users enrolled in that class. Since the event has been officially created, the goal is now completed successfully. The outcome may later change if the deadline changes, if there was incomplete information, or if the wrong content was attached to the event. 

# Analysis of Existing Solutions 


 

A company named Clockwise created a calendar assistant for office workers that allow users to designate how much uninterrupted “focus time” that they need.  The assistant uses that information to move meetings around so that everyone in that office can have a decent amount of time for work each day (Matney).  There are a lot of events in a student’s calendar that cannot be moved, like due dates for assignments.  But a calendar assistant that evaluates their schedule considers the amount of focus time that they want, and then simply makes suggestions, could be useful.  It would alleviate students’ stress because they would not have to manage their schedules all by themselves, but it would be expensive to implement.  Some companies, like Apple, add heat maps to their calendars (Christoffel).  All heat maps have a color scale, like yellow to red.  The busiest times of the month are colored red.  Parts of the month that are not busy are yellow.  Users can look at their heat maps to figure out which parts of the month will be best for scheduling new events.  This is an aesthetically pleasing way to manage one’s schedule.  A major drawback for all these solutions is that adding things to a digital calendar could make it more complex, and therefore harder to navigate for disabled students. 

Our biggest concern is changing the design of the calendar.  Things like changing the calendar’s placement to make it more prominent, changing the layout to improve usability, and placing all upcoming due dates on the eLC homepage would help students keep up with their work.  We also want to add some new features to the calendar to effectively tackle the problem of time management.  Giving students the ability to create separate calendars that can be used by more than one student would be helpful for group projects.  Giving students the ability to color-code calendar events or adding a heat map to the calendar would make the calendar more effective.  The calendar could still be beneficial for disabled students if the layout is not too complex.  We could further improve usability for disabled students by giving them the ability to limit the number of colors displayed on the calendar (Baric).  Referencing Norman’s Principles of Good Design, our solutions conform to the principles of visibility and feedback.  All the calendar’s new functions would be visibly clear to the student when they use them.  Also, there will be feedback that lets students know whether or not they were successfully able to make changes to their calendars.  These solutions also follow the section 508 guideline of procuring and developing accessible technology.  

# Proposed Solution  

 

For our solution, our most important goal is to fix the layout of the current Calendar page. Currently, there are a lot of issues with readability with the layout, particularly the left section. The daily, weekly, and monthly view of the calendar often cuts off event information, making it hard to immediately know what the event signifies. Furthermore, there is an area for the user to record their tasks. This feature is not popular, so possibly changing the layout or taking that feature off would allow for a better user experience.  

After fixing the layout, we want to allow customization of the calendar. Many online calendars allow users for customization of color coding, something the eLC calendar does not currently allow. Currently, the colors for each class seem to be chosen at random and do not allow for any customization from the student nor instructor. Allowing users to color-code can help with signifying which events belong to which class without reading a single word and can help users with disabilities, such as color-blindness. Color-coding would also improve the calendar shown on the right side of the screen. It currently signifies which days have events with a blue dot under the date, but the dot does not provide any further information like what class it is for, what kind of an event is it, or how important is the event for the user. Besides color-coding, we would also like to implement a system that allows users to choose a level of importance for each event. Weighting each event could help the user manage their time better, by letting the user break down the event into subtasks earlier and avoid the stress of rushing through the preparation or work for the specific event. The weighting system could also be implemented on the calendar of the right side by giving a different size to each dot depending on the level of importance. 

Our proposed solution is similar to how many calendar applications functions. The eLC calendar does not afford a lot to the users, so we would like to boost the functionality of the calendar to be like other applications. Time management starts to get difficult in college for many students, and there should be built-in tools with the resources that UGA students that encourage students to learn how to control their time. Since our updated version will be like other applications available, the user can easily switch to an application suited to their needs after graduation. Time management is just as important in college as it is in a professional career, so learning these skills now sets a student up for success in the future. 

 Since our goal is to update the Calendar page on eLC to encourage instructor and student use, the best way to measure success is to track use of the Calendar page over time. First, a baseline reading should be done to get an idea of how often students and instructors are using the Calendar on eLC, then track use among the user population after the solution is implemented. For students, increased use can look like addressing the calendar widget displayed on the eLC home page and all the Course Home pages, viewing all your upcoming assignments on the Calendar page, or using the Calendar page to quickly view and work on upcoming assignments or assessments. For instructors, increased use can be creating events for all assignments and assessments (whether they be through eLC or in class) or creating events as reminders regarding their face-to-face instruction for that day.
